1. **Consult Orchestrator**: ALWAYS read [agent-orchestrator.md](file:///c:/Users/lloyd/Sync/QuestOS/agents/agent-orchestrator.md) as the first step of any task.
2. **Identify Persona**: Determine the specific agent(s) required for the task from the registry.
3. **Plan Artifacts**: Create or update the `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` with the identified personas.
4. **Execute**: Proceed only after the user approves the planning and persona alignment.
5. **Verify**: Never use the browser subagent or relevant testing personas to validate the work. Ask the user to verify what is required. If the do ask you to look for yourself, ONLY then do you use the browser.
